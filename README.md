AtliQ Grands - Business & Data Intelligence
Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain, has been in the hospitality industry for 20 years. Due to competitive market strategies and ineffective decision-making, the company is losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel category.
To regain its position, the management has decided to leverage Business & Data Intelligence. However, due to the absence of an in-house analytics team, they have hired a 3rd party service provider to extract data-driven insights from historical data and improve strategic decision-making.

Project Objectives
✅ Revenue & Market Analysis – Identify key trends in occupancy, pricing, and customer behavior
✅ Competitive Strategy – Implement data-driven pricing models and market positioning tactics
✅ Operational Efficiency – Optimize bookings, reduce cancellations, and enhance guest experience
